## üß† Code Logic & PID Control  

### **What is PID Control?**  
PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control helps adjust motor speed based on sensor input to maintain the robot‚Äôs stability.  

### **PID Formula Used**  
\[
\text{Correction} = (K_p \times \text{Error}) + (K_d \times \text{Derivative}) + (K_i \times \text{Integral})
\]
Where:  
- **Kp (Proportional Gain)** ‚Üí Reacts to current error  
- **Ki (Integral Gain)** ‚Üí Corrects accumulated past errors (set to 0 in our case)  
- **Kd (Derivative Gain)** ‚Üí Predicts future error  

### **PID Tuning Parameters**  

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Kp | 12 | Determines reaction to error |
| Ki | 0 | Not used in this setup |
| Kd | 36 | Helps stabilize robot |

### **Code Flow**  
1. **Sensor Reading**: IR sensor array detects black line positions.  
2. **Error Calculation**: The error is computed using a weighted sum approach.  
3. **PID Computation**: Adjusts motor speed based on error.  
4. **Motor Control**: Updates PWM values to correct deviations.  

### **Key Functions**  
- `readSensors()`: Reads IR sensor values.  
- `computeError()`: Calculates deviation from line.  
- `computePID()`: Uses the PID formula to generate correction values.  
- `adjustMotorSpeeds()`: Modifies motor speed based on correction output.
