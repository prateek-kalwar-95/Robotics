## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### 💡 LED Circuit Issues

**Problem: LEDs not lighting up**
```
Diagnostic Steps:
✓ Check LED polarity (long leg = anode = positive)
✓ Verify resistor value (220Ω for 5V supply)
✓ Test with multimeter for continuity
✓ Try different digital pins
✓ Measure voltage across LED (should be ~2V)

Common Solutions:
• Reverse LED orientation
• Replace burned-out LED
• Check Arduino pin functionality

**Problem: LEDs too dim or too bright**
```
Causes & Solutions:
• Too dim: Reduce resistor value (try 150Ω)
• Too bright: Increase resistor value (try 330Ω)  
• Calculate optimal: R = (Vsupply - VLED) / ILED
• For standard LED: R = (5V - 2V) / 0.02A = 150Ω
```
